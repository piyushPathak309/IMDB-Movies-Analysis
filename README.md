# IMDB-Movies-Analysis

# First-Porfolio-Project-IMDB-Movie-Analysis
# Intro :- **IMDB** means internet movie database it includes information related to movies, web series, t.v. series and so on..

## Problem Statement ðŸ‘Ž
 ##### The Film Companies was facing issues with Viewers Choice, they wanted to know what they really like so that they could generate successful movies.
 
## Objective :-
#### Purpose of this project is to explore IMDB Dataset and finding some business questions as,
###### "The Gross Revenue Analysis Of Movies", "Movies Which got most voting and rating by viewers","In Which year most movies released".. and many more.. these all results can help film companies to understand the secret of generating a successful movies which viewers mostly like.

### Tools used :-
###### Python, Pandas, Beautifulsoup,Requests,PowerBi,JupyterNotebook

## DataCollection :-
#### I extracted dataset from Wikipedia using **Python,BeautifulSoup,Pandas and requests libraries** dataset was containing columns as MovieTitle,Rating,Voting,Metascore,Runtime ,Releasing_Year,Gross_Revenue and so on.. after loaded dataset put all these into Dataframe and then conveted into CSV format.

## DataCleaning :-
#### Loaded my dataset into powerbi and performed datacleaning ,into powerquery editor which is self service ETL tool of PowerBi, dataset was containing  null values, duplicate values,some column's data type was missing , column header missing ,renaming a column... so i performed transformation on these all in my dataset and cleaned my dataset for visualization.

## Datamodelling :-
##### As my dataset is containing only one table so i did not establish any connections but if i do connection then definitely do start-schema.

## DataVisualization :-
##### Performed data visualization and used many charts and graphs some of them are as i used line chart to see the trend of revenue in different time period(Year), used scatter chart to see the relationship between movie rating and movie voting and many more like this used some KPI also as **Total revenue, Total Movie released**, find ranking of movies in terms of revenue ... this way i performed visualization and derive many useful insights.

## Insights :- I Derived many insights some of them are-
### -> Total Gross Earned is $56K.
### -> Maximum Movies Released In 2004.
